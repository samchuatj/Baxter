# Enhanced Telegram Expense Editing Functionality

## Overview

Users can now request expense updates through Telegram using natural language, and the LLM will intelligently handle updating any column in the expense table for them.

## How It Works

### 1. Natural Language Processing
Users can send edit requests in plain English through Telegram. The LLM analyzes the message to:
- Identify which expense needs to be updated
- Determine which fields should be changed
- Extract the new values for those fields

### 2. Replied-to Message Context
When users reply to a message containing expense details, the system:
- Extracts expense information from the replied-to message
- Uses those details as primary filter criteria
- Combines with the user's edit request for precise identification

### 3. Smart Expense Identification
The system uses multiple criteria to find the correct expense:
- **Date**: Specific dates, relative dates (yesterday, last week), or date ranges
- **Merchant Name**: Exact matches or partial matches
- **Amount**: Exact amounts or approximate amounts
- **Business Purpose**: Category names or descriptions
- **Context**: Recent expenses, specific time periods, or contextual clues
- **Replied-to Message**: Expense details from the message being replied to

### 4. Field Updates
Any expense field can be updated:
- **Date**: Change when the expense occurred
- **Merchant Name**: Update the store or service provider name
- **Total Amount**: Modify the expense amount
- **Business Purpose**: Change the category or classification

## Example Usage

### Basic Edit Requests
```
"Change the amount of my coffee expense from yesterday to $15.50"
"Update the merchant name for my lunch expense to 'New Restaurant'"
"Change the category of my travel expense to 'Business Travel'"
"Update the date of my software subscription to January 15th"
```

### Reply-to-Message Edit Requests
```
User replies "update the amount to 15" to:
"✓ Expense created! 🎉
💵 Amount: $25.3
🏪 Merchant: Grab
📅 Date: 2025-07-25
🏷️ Category: Travel"

User replies "change the merchant to Starbucks" to:
"📄 Receipt for: Coffee Shop - $12.50 (Food) - 2024-07-19"

User replies "that was actually business travel" to:
"📊 Your recent expenses:
• Starbucks - $8.75 (Food) - 2024-07-20"
```

### Natural Language Corrections
```
"The coffee was actually $18.75, not $15.50"
"That was actually a business lunch, not personal food"
"Fix the date to yesterday"
"The merchant name should be 'Starbucks Downtown'"
```

### Multiple Field Updates
```
"Change my coffee expense amount to $12.50 and update the merchant to 'Starbucks Downtown'"
"Update the date to January 15th and change the category to Travel"
```

### Contextual Updates
```
"Change the amount to $25" (system looks for most recent expense)
"Update the merchant name" (system looks for recent expense with similar amount/date)
"Change the category to Travel" (system looks for travel-related expenses)
```

## Technical Implementation

### LLM Prompt Enhancement
The system prompt now includes:
- Detailed examples of edit requests
- Guidance on natural language interpretation
- Instructions for smart expense identification
- Support for all expense fields

### Edit Action Processing
```json
{
  "action": "edit",
  "filter": { 
    "date": "2024-07-19", 
    "merchant": "Coffee Shop", 
    "amount": 12.34 
  },
  "fields_to_update": { 
    "date": "2024-07-20",
    "merchant_name": "New Merchant Name", 
    "total_amount": 20.00,
    "business_purpose": "New Category"
  }
}
```

### Business Purpose Mapping
- Automatically maps business purpose names to IDs
- Validates that requested categories exist
- Provides helpful error messages for invalid categories

### Success Feedback
Users receive detailed confirmation messages showing exactly what was changed:
```
✅ Expense updated successfully! ✏️

📅 Date: 2024-07-20
🏪 Merchant: New Merchant Name
💵 Amount: $20.00
🏷️ Category: Travel
```

## Error Handling

### Ambiguous Requests
If multiple expenses match the criteria:
```
❌ Multiple expenses match your description. 🧐
Please be more specific (e.g., include date, merchant, and amount).
```

### No Matching Expenses
If no expenses match the criteria:
```
❌ Could not find any matching expense to update. 🕵️
Please check your details and try again.
```

### Invalid Categories
If a business purpose doesn't exist:
```
⚠️ Business purpose "Invalid Category" not found. 
Available categories: Food, Travel, Software Subscription, Others
```

### Database Errors
If the update fails:
```
❌ Failed to update expense. 😢
Reason: [specific error message]
```

## Security Features

- **User Isolation**: Users can only edit their own expenses
- **RLS Policies**: Database-level security prevents unauthorized access
- **Input Validation**: All updates are validated before processing
- **Audit Trail**: All changes are logged with timestamps

## Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Be Specific**: Include as much detail as possible (date, merchant, amount)
2. **Use Natural Language**: No need for exact syntax - just describe what you want
3. **Provide Context**: Mention recent activities or time periods if relevant
4. **Check Confirmation**: Always verify the changes in the confirmation message

### For the System
1. **Smart Matching**: Use multiple criteria to identify the correct expense
2. **Clear Feedback**: Provide detailed success/error messages
3. **Validation**: Ensure all updates are valid before applying
4. **Fallback**: Ask for clarification when requests are ambiguous

## Integration with Existing Features

The edit functionality works seamlessly with:
- **Expense Creation**: Edit expenses created from receipt images
- **Business Purpose Management**: Update categories and create new ones
- **Receipt Downloads**: Edit expenses and then download their receipts
- **Filtering and Search**: Edit expenses found through various filters

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- **Bulk Updates**: Edit multiple expenses at once
- **Template Updates**: Apply common changes to similar expenses
- **Undo Functionality**: Revert recent changes
