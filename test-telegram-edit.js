console.log("ðŸ“‹ How it works:");
console.log("1. User sends natural language edit request via Telegram");
console.log("2. LLM analyzes the message and identifies the expense to edit");
console.log("3. LLM determines which fields need to be updated");
console.log("4. System finds the matching expense using filters (date, merchant, amount, etc.)");
console.log("5. System updates the expense with the new values");
console.log("6. User receives confirmation with details of what was changed");
console.log("");

console.log("ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:");
console.log("âœ… Natural language processing - no need for exact syntax");
console.log("âœ… Smart expense identification using multiple criteria");
console.log("âœ… Support for updating any expense field (date, merchant, amount, category)");
console.log("âœ… Business purpose name to ID mapping");
console.log("âœ… Detailed success messages showing what was changed");
console.log("âœ… Error handling for ambiguous or invalid requests");
console.log("");

console.log("ðŸ’¡ Example Usage:");
console.log("- 'Change the amount to $25'");
console.log("- 'Update the merchant name to Starbucks'");
console.log("- 'Change the category to Travel'");
console.log("- 'Fix the date to yesterday'");
console.log("- 'That was actually a business expense'");
console.log("- 'The coffee was $18.75, not $15.50'");
