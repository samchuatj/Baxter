console.log("📋 How Enhanced Chat Context Works:");
console.log("1. System fetches last 10 messages from telegram_messages table");
console.log("2. Messages are formatted with user/bot prefixes and timestamps");
console.log("3. Original user messages are preserved (not processed versions)");
console.log("4. Long messages are truncated to keep context manageable");
console.log("5. LLM receives full conversation history as context");
console.log("6. LLM can understand conversation flow and user intent");
console.log("");

console.log("🎯 Key Improvements:");
console.log("✅ Better message formatting with user/bot prefixes");
console.log("✅ Preserved original user messages for context");
console.log("✅ Truncated long messages to stay within token limits");
console.log("✅ Enhanced timestamps for better temporal context");
console.log("✅ LLM guidance on how to use chat context");
console.log("✅ Pattern recognition across conversation history");
console.log("");

console.log("💡 Context Usage Examples:");
console.log("- Previous expense creation → Edit that specific expense");
console.log("- Recent expense lists → Reference specific items from the list");
console.log("- Correction patterns → Understand user is fixing previous mistakes");
console.log("- Business purpose changes → Update categories based on context");
console.log("- Amount adjustments → Recognize pattern of value changes");
console.log("");

console.log("🔧 Technical Implementation:");
console.log("- Messages stored in telegram_messages table with original_message field");
console.log("- Chat log fetched with ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10");
console.log("- Messages reversed to show chronological order");
console.log("- User messages use original_message, bot responses use processed message");
console.log("- Context included in system prompt for LLM analysis");
console.log("- LLM guidance on how to interpret and use the context");
